# MPPI cost-function review

This document describes the cost functions currently implemented by
`autoware_mppi_optimizer`. It is based on the first-order Dubins bicycle cost in
`include/mppi/cost_functions/dubins/first_order_dubins_bicycle_cost.{cuh,cu}`, the host-side
integration in `src/first_order_dubins/first_order_dubins_mppi_interface.cu`, and the rollout and
weighting code supplied by `mppi_generic_vendor`.

The package contains one concrete rollout cost class,
`FirstOrderDubinsBicycleCost<NUM_TIMESTEPS>`. The files `moving_car_obstacles.hpp`,
`parked_car_obstacles.hpp`, `path_tracking_geometry.cuh`, `sat.cuh`, and the distance-map files are
geometry, scenario, or acceleration helpers; they do not define additional additive objectives.

## 1. Objective assembly

For the configured horizon `H = 80`, each rollout is integrated with `dt = 0.1 s`. A stage cost is
evaluated on every **post-step** state, including the final post-step state. A terminal cost is then
evaluated on that same final state:

```text
            H-1
J_rollout = ( sum [L_state(k) + L_control(k) + L_comfort(k) + L_sampling(k)]
             k=0
              + Phi(x_H) ) / H
```

Consequences:

- All running and terminal components are horizon-averaged; they are not multiplied by `dt`.
- The final state contributes once to the final running stage and once to the terminal cost.
- `L_sampling` is the MPPI-Generic likelihood-ratio term. The active colored-noise sampler inherits
  this term, but its `control_cost_coeff` array is left at zero by this package, so it currently
  contributes zero. It is not part of `FirstOrderDubinsMppiCostBreakdown`.
- A non-positive coefficient disables its corresponding ordinary quadratic term. Environment
  barriers have the activation rules described below.

The reported `FirstOrderDubinsMppiCostBreakdown` is reconstructed on the CPU using the same model
and cost equations, then divided by `H`. It describes the returned control sequence after optional
steering filtering and velocity-profile enforcement. It therefore need not equal the GPU baseline,
which is the minimum sampled rollout cost before those post-processing steps.

## 2. Notation and reference data

The formulas below use:

- `p = (x, y)`: rear-axle position of a post-step rollout state.
- `psi`: rollout yaw.
- `v`, `a`, and `delta`: longitudinal velocity, acceleration state, and steering state.
- `u_a` and `u_delta`: constrained acceleration and steering commands.
- `p_ref[k]` and `psi_ref[k]`: index-aligned reference position and yaw at stage `k`.
- `p_end` and `psi_end`: final pose of the full input reference trajectory, not merely the end of
  the 80-sample reference horizon.
- `wrap(q)`: shortest signed angular distance in `[-pi, pi]`.
- `C`: the full spatial reference corridor, capped/downsampled to 256 vertices.
- `s`: clamped cumulative chord length of the closest projection onto `C`.
- `s_total`: total corridor chord length.
- `e_lat`: signed closest-segment cross-track error; positive is left of the segment tangent.
- `[z]_+ = max(0, z)`.

The spatial corridor is preferred for all spatial costs. If it contains fewer than two points,
the index-aligned 80-sample reference polyline is used instead. GPU projection is warm-started from
the previous stage's closest segment; the first projection performs a full scan.

`running_total`, `terminal_total`, and `total` are aggregates, not independent costs.

## 4. Reference-tracking costs

### 4.1 Index-aligned position tracking

```text
L_track(k) = track_coeff * ||p - p_ref[k]||^2
```

This tracks the rear axle. Despite being commonly called time-indexed tracking, the reference
builder currently selects input point `k + start_idx`; it does not interpolate the source
trajectory by `k * dt`. Its temporal meaning therefore depends on the sampling of the incoming
trajectory.

At the terminal state, the same term is evaluated against `p_ref[H-1]` and multiplied by
`track_terminal_scale`.

### 4.2 Index-aligned heading tracking

```text
L_heading(k) = heading_coeff * wrap(psi - psi_ref[k])^2
```

The terminal copy is also multiplied by `track_terminal_scale`.

### 4.3 Vehicle-center tracking

The rear-axle pose is shifted forward by `ego_axle_to_box_center`:

```text
p_center = p + ego_axle_to_box_center * (cos(psi), sin(psi))
L_center(k) = track_center_coeff * ||p_center - p_ref[k]||^2
```

This can be used instead of, or in addition to, rear-axle `track`. Its terminal copy is multiplied
by `track_terminal_scale`.

## 5. Terminal-goal costs

These independent terms compare the final rollout state to the end of the **full** input
trajectory:

```text
Phi_terminal_position = terminal_error_coeff * ||p_H - p_end||^2
Phi_terminal_heading  = terminal_heading_coeff * wrap(psi_H - psi_end)^2
```

They are not multiplied by `track_terminal_scale`. This permits the index-aligned tracking terms
to be disabled while retaining a strong full-trajectory terminal objective.

## 6. Spatial corridor costs

The rollout point is projected onto the closest segment of the full diffusion-reference polyline.
The projection provides `e_lat`, segment tangent yaw, `s`, remaining length, tip overshoot, and an
interpolated reference velocity.

### 6.1 Lateral distance

```text
L_lateral = lateral_distance_coeff * e_lat^2
```

At the terminal state this is multiplied by `track_terminal_scale`.

### 6.2 Lateral yaw error

```text
L_lateral_yaw = lateral_yaw_error_coeff * wrap(psi - psi_segment)^2
```

At the terminal state this is multiplied by `track_terminal_scale`.

### 6.3 Remaining distance

The projection arc length is clamped to `[0, s_total]`:

```text
s_remaining = s_total - s
L_remaining = remaining_distance_coeff * s_remaining^2
```

This term is applied at every running stage, so it rewards spatial progress throughout the
rollout. At the terminal state it is multiplied by `track_terminal_scale`.

### 6.4 Path overshoot

Overshoot is nonzero only when the closest projection lies past the final endpoint along the last
segment's forward extension:

```text
L_overshoot = path_overshoot_coeff * s_overshoot^2
```

At the terminal state this is multiplied by `track_terminal_scale`.

### 6.5 Spatial reference-velocity overspeed

Reference velocity is linearly interpolated between the vertices of the closest corridor segment.
The corridor is built after an active external/map velocity-limit profile has been applied, so the
profile may already include those limits.

```text
progress  = clamp(s / s_total, 0, 1)
overspeed = v - v_ref(s)
L_spatial_overspeed = spatial_overspeed_coeff * progress * [overspeed]_+^2
```

The term is disabled when `s_total <= 1e-6 m` and is deliberately omitted from the terminal cost.
Its progress multiplier makes reference overspeed nearly free at the path start and strongest at
the end.

### 6.6 Lateral-boundary barrier

The hard corridor threshold is symmetric about the reference:

```text
d_boundary = boundary_threshold - |e_lat|
L_lateral_boundary = W_lat * [lateral_boundary_soft_margin - d_boundary]_+^2
```

The interface derives:

```text
W_lat = crash_contact_penalty / max(lateral_boundary_soft_margin, 1e-3)^2
```

Thus the barrier begins at
`|e_lat| = boundary_threshold - lateral_boundary_soft_margin`, equals
`crash_contact_penalty` at `|e_lat| = boundary_threshold`, and grows quadratically beyond it. It is
also evaluated at the terminal state, but is **not** multiplied by `track_terminal_scale`.

### 6.7 Preferred-route lane centering

```text
d_preferred = min distance(p, segment), over selected preferred lanelet centerline segments
L_preferred_lane_center = preferred_lane_center_coeff * d_preferred^2
```

This independent spatial objective follows the map's preferred route lanelets, even when the
incoming diffusion reference is offset. It evaluates the rear axle and has no heading or footprint
term. Its terminal copy is multiplied by `track_terminal_scale`; both copies use the existing
horizon average. `preferred_lane_center_coeff` defaults to zero (disabled).

The plugin extracts centerlines from route sections' `preferred_primitive.id`. Ego association
uses all route primitives, polygon containment, forward heading, and a 2 m elevation tolerance.
Route order and previous association disambiguate local route occurrences where possible.
A local interval includes 10 m behind ego and the greater of reference length and the 8 s
reachable-distance bound, plus 10 m ahead. Individual lanelet segments remain disconnected where
map centerlines are disconnected; no connecting line is invented. Finite segment endpoints exert
longitudinal attraction beyond their ends.

A dedicated 1024 × 1024, 0.15 m `float` texture stores unsigned distance, adding 4 MiB when used.
It shares the environment maps' snapped grid definition but owns independent geometry, cache,
and CUDA resources. GPU queries use bilinear interpolation; CPU breakdowns and GPU queries
outside the interpolation interior use exact segment distances. Small nonzero sampled costs
on the true centerline and grid-phase sensitivity are expected at this resolution.

Unavailable, ambiguous, invalid, frame-mismatched, or over-capacity geometry disables this optional
term and publishes a status. The 256-segment capacity is independent of boundary/reference limits;
overflow clears the target instead of truncating it. Omitted per-call input also clears it.
Route preference edits invalidate extraction even when the route UUID is unchanged.

This preference can conflict with reference tracking and the reference `boundary_threshold`
acceptance rule. It does not guarantee lane containment or choose direction at overlapping XY
centerlines. Tune with obstacles, curves, lane changes, and rejection behavior in view. Debug
markers show the selected centerlines; logs record their geometry for offline retuning.

## 7. Command and comfort costs

The rollout kernel constrains controls before dynamics integration and cost evaluation.

### 7.1 Command magnitude

```text
L_accel_command = accel_cmd_coeff * u_a^2
L_steer_command = steer_cmd_coeff * u_delta^2
```

These terms bias commands toward zero; they do not penalize changes relative to the nominal
sequence or the previous command.

### 7.2 Modeled longitudinal jerk and steering rate

The dynamics computes these rates from realized state increments after applying delay queues,
actuator lag, steering-rate limiting, and state saturation:

```text
j_long     = (a_next - a_pre) / dt
delta_rate = (delta_next - delta_pre) / dt

L_longitudinal_jerk = longitudinal_jerk_coeff * j_long^2
L_steering_rate     = steer_rate_coeff * delta_rate^2
```

`comfortTerms()` reads `LONGITUDINAL_JERK` and `STEERING_RATE` from the transition output. The same
physical longitudinal jerk feeds the optional jerk-limit cost. A command merely appended to a delay
queue has no physical jerk cost until it changes the actuator state.

Issued-command changes are regularized independently using successive issued commands divided by
`dt`. These command-change terms are omitted at stage zero, where the previous command is not
established by the horizon; zero-filled history is not interpreted as a real prior command.

At the first rollout stage only, a separate transient cost compares the issued steering command
with the measured pre-rollout steering state:

```text
initial_delta_rate = (u_delta[0] - delta_initial) / control_dt
L_initial_steering_rate[0] =
  initial_steer_rate_coeff * initial_delta_rate^2 * horizon_length
```

The rollout-wide horizon average cancels `horizon_length`, so this one-shot coefficient has a
tuning scale comparable to a running steering-rate coefficient.

### 7.3 Lateral acceleration and jerk

```text
kappa       = tan(delta) / wheel_base
kappa_rate  = sec(delta)^2 * delta_rate / wheel_base
a_lateral   = v^2 * kappa
j_lateral   = v^2 * kappa_rate + 3 * v * a * kappa

L_lateral_acceleration = lateral_acceleration_coeff * a_lateral^2
L_lateral_jerk         = lateral_jerk_coeff * j_lateral^2
```

Lateral acceleration uses post-step velocity and steering. Lateral jerk is the inertial lateral
component in vehicle coordinates: its formula above uses pre-step velocity/curvature and realized
`delta_rate` and `(v_next - v_pre) / dt` for acceleration. The coefficient three includes the rotating
frame contribution; the scalar derivative of lateral acceleration alone would use two.

## 8. Kinematic-limit costs

Optional intervals can be supplied for velocity, longitudinal acceleration, and longitudinal
jerk. The live plugin obtains velocity/acceleration/jerk constraints from `VelocityLimit`; an
optional lanelet velocity profile can add pointwise velocity bounds.

For an interval `[lower, upper]`, define:

```text
interval_violation(z) = [lower - z]_+^2 + [z - upper]_+^2
```

The component quantities are:

```text
q_velocity     = interval_violation(v)
q_acceleration = 0.5^2 * interval_violation(a)
q_jerk         = 0.2^2 * interval_violation(j_long)
```

Equivalently, acceleration violations are multiplied by `0.5` before squaring and jerk violations
by `0.2` before squaring. The shared uncapped cost is
`overlimit_coeff * (q_velocity + q_acceleration + q_jerk)`.

The complete per-stage kinematic-limit cost is capped at `crash_contact_penalty`. When the sum is
capped, the three diagnostic components are proportionally scaled so their sum remains equal to
the cap. Inactive intervals contribute zero. A pointwise reference velocity limit at stage `k`
sets the velocity interval to `[0, ref_max_velocity[k]]`.

These are soft costs. The dynamics separately clamp acceleration commands/states and, by default,
prevent reverse velocity.

## 9. Environment-clearance costs

All three environment terms use the generic quadratic barrier:

```text
B(d, margin, weight) = weight * [margin - d]_+^2
```

Distances are computed from a four-circle conservative approximation of the ego footprint. The
circle centers lie along the vehicle centerline and each circle encloses its corresponding
longitudinal box slice.

On the GPU, road/drivable distances use a 1024 x 1024, 0.15 m 2D texture and obstacle distances use
a 512 x 512 x H, 0.30 m 3D texture. Hardware interpolation smooths the sampled field. Samples
outside a texture grid fall back to exact segment/OBB geometry, rather than using clamped texture
coordinates. The CPU breakdown always uses exact geometry, so small texture-resolution differences
between optimized GPU costs and the reconstructed breakdown are expected.

### 9.1 Obstacle barrier

`d_obstacle` is the minimum signed clearance from the four-circle ego approximation to the closest
oriented obstacle box at stage `k`:

```text
L_obstacle = W_obstacle *
             [obstacle_collision_margin + obstacle_safe_margin - d_obstacle]_+^2

W_obstacle = crash_contact_penalty / max(obstacle_safe_margin, 1e-3)^2
```

The cost begins outside the circle-based collision envelope, equals `crash_contact_penalty` when
circle-based clearance reaches `obstacle_collision_margin`, and grows beyond that value during overlap. Static
and time-varying obstacle trajectories both participate. The implementation stores at most 64
obstacles.

The runtime parameter `dynamic_obstacle_horizon_s` limits how far into the future moving
objects participate in obstacle costs and final OBB collision validation. Its default, `0.0`,
uses the full MPPI horizon and preserves the previous behavior. A positive value includes only
post-step samples with `(k + 1) * dt <= dynamic_obstacle_horizon_s`, measured from the current
planning state. For example, `3.0` includes predictions through 3 seconds. A positive value
smaller than `dt` includes no moving-object samples; values beyond the MPPI horizon use every
sample. Negative and nonfinite values are rejected.

Objects whose supplied predicted pose stays constant within the existing `1e-4` position/yaw
tolerance are considered stationary and remain active for the full horizon. Moving objects are
omitted after the cutoff, without freezing their final pose. This rule applies to GPU distance-map
layers, exact CPU/out-of-grid distances, terminal costs, unsafe-rollout flags, and final collision
validation. Changing the limit invalidates the obstacle map even if object geometry is unchanged.
Debug logs record the parameter in `runtime_options.csv`; offline replay restores it and accepts
`--set dynamic_obstacle_horizon_s=3.0` or a YAML override. Older logs default to the full horizon.

Obstacle and road-border costs keep their smooth distance fields. Eligibility uses the field only
as a conservative proximity filter, then checks the inflated rectangular ego footprint against
obstacle boxes or road-border segments with the same exact routines as final validation. Circle
contact alone no longer excludes a rollout. The exact check also supplies the intersecting geometry
index used by failure diagnostics.

The proximity band is `sqrt(2) * (collision_margin + grid_resolution)` plus a float-roundoff
allowance. The first term covers the corners added by rectangular inflation; the second covers
spatial texture interpolation error for the distance field. Analytical queries use zero grid
resolution. Every near or penetrating sample receives an exact check; sufficiently separated
samples avoid it. This preserves the barrier values, enabled/disabled barrier behavior, and dynamic
object horizon. Lateral-boundary eligibility continues to use `boundary_threshold`.

### 9.2 Road-border barrier

`d_road` is the nonnegative minimum clearance from the four-circle ego approximation to a road
border segment:

```text
L_road = W_road *
         [road_border_collision_margin + road_border_safe_margin - d_road]_+^2

W_road = crash_contact_penalty / max(road_border_safe_margin, 1e-3)^2
```

It equals `crash_contact_penalty` at the circle-based collision-margin boundary. Up to 256 road-border segments
are stored.

### 9.3 Drivable-area boundary barrier

```text
L_drivable = drivable_area_barrier_weight *
             [drivable_area_safe_margin - d_drivable]_+^2
```

`d_drivable` is the minimum segment clearance minus the ego-circle radius, so it becomes negative
when the circle approximation overlaps a supplied boundary segment. Unlike the lateral, obstacle,
and road-border barriers, this weight is supplied directly and is not derived from
`crash_contact_penalty`. Up to 256 drivable-area boundary segments are stored.

This is a distance-to-segments field, not a polygon signed-distance field: it does not distinguish
the inside from the outside of the drivable area.

### 9.4 Corner buffer

For the four exact corners of the ego oriented box:

```text
L_corner = corner_buffer_coeff *
           sum_over_corners [corner_safe_margin - d_corner]_+^2
```

Each `d_corner` is the unsigned distance to the closest drivable-area boundary segment. The term is
disabled when no drivable segments are present or `corner_buffer_coeff <= 0`.

## 10. Terminal composition

The unscaled terminal cost is:

```text
Phi = track_terminal_scale *
        (track + heading + lateral_distance + lateral_yaw_error
         + remaining_distance + path_overshoot + preferred_lane_center + track_center)
      + terminal_error + terminal_heading
      + lateral_boundary + corner_buffer
      + drivable_area + obstacle + road_border
```

The names in this expression denote their coefficient-weighted forms. Spatial overspeed, command,
comfort, and kinematic-limit costs do not have terminal copies. Setting `track_terminal_scale = 0`
does not disable the independent terminal pose terms or the terminal safety barriers.

## 11. Hard validation is not a rollout cost

After optimization and post-processing, `validateOptimizedTrajectory()` rejects the returned
trajectory at the first state that has any of these conditions:

- `|e_lat| >= boundary_threshold`;
- ego OBB (inflated by `obstacle_collision_margin`) overlaps an obstacle OBB;
- ego OBB (inflated by `road_border_collision_margin`) intersects a road-border segment;
- velocity is negative.

When `min_trajectory_progress_m > 0`, validation also projects the first and last optimized
post-step states onto the lateral corridor (or reference fallback). It reports
`insufficient_progress` when `last_s - first_s` is below the configured distance. A value of zero
disables this trajectory-level condition. Equality passes.

This validation does not add `crash_contact_penalty` to rollouts. The rollout cost now sets its
`crash_status` safety flag when it detects lateral-boundary contact, obstacle contact, or road-border
contact. These flags exclude unsafe rollouts from weighting and supply the diagnostic
`unsafe_rollout_fraction`; they do not themselves add another cost. `crash_contact_penalty` serves three cost-calibration roles:

1. calibration target for the lateral-boundary barrier;
2. calibration target for obstacle and road-border barriers;
3. numerical cap for the combined kinematic-limit cost at one running stage.

There is no hard drivable-area polygon validation. The runtime `skip_if_invalid` option determines
whether a failed optimized output is rejected.

## 12. Cost normalization and MPPI weights

Only finite, collision-free rollouts are eligible for weighting. Unsafe and nonfinite rollouts
receive exactly zero weight, regardless of lambda. Four GPU radix-selection passes find the exact
nearest-rank percentile among eligible raw costs; extreme outliers cannot reduce its resolution.

```text
J_min          = min(J_eligible)
J_upper        = percentile(J_eligible, cost_normalization_percentile)
S_i_normalized = clamp((J_i - J_min) / (J_upper - J_min), 0, 1)
w_i_raw        = exp(-S_i_normalized / lambda)    # eligible samples only
w_i            = w_i_raw / sum(w_raw)
ESS            = 1 / sum(w_i^2)
```

When the retained cost range is below `1e-6`, eligible costs at or below the percentile receive
normalized cost zero and the upper tail receives one. With no eligible weight, the device reduction
preserves its previous mean. Any such iteration makes the control step fail without applying a
candidate or adapting lambda. The interface records `no_eligible_rollouts` and returns its
reference fallback, including active velocity limits, regardless of `skip_if_invalid`. A weighted
mean of safe rollouts still needs the normal output trajectory validation.

### Rollout failure diagnostics

`failed_rollout_iteration` identifies the first failed iteration (zero-based; `-1` on success).
The summary eligible count, unsafe fraction, and normalization statistics describe that iteration
on failure and the last iteration on success. Per-iteration ESS and population diagnostics remain
available even when an earlier iteration fails and a later one recovers. No eligible baseline is
reported as NaN rather than reusing a previous cycle's best cost. Raw rollout visualizations still
represent the last sampled iteration; the preserved nominal's validation is a separate result.

Each population reports eligible, nonfinite-cost, unsafe, lateral-boundary, obstacle, and
road-border counts, plus weight sum and ESS. Reason counts overlap when one rollout violates
several constraints, and unsafe rollouts may also have nonfinite costs. The earliest geometric
violation includes its zero-based stage, time `(stage + 1) * dt`, type, and first intersecting
obstacle/road-border index in the supplied frame. Obstacle events also include the tracked-object
UUID. Ties are resolved by stage, then type (lateral, obstacle, road border), then geometry index.

Geometry identity comes from exact collision testing, not the nearest distance-field primitive.
Nonfinite total costs have no geometric event unless
that population also contains a geometric violation; unavailable stages/indices/times are `-1`,
with type `unavailable`. The existing dynamic-object horizon also applies to these obstacle events.
The fallback policy is unchanged.

ROS cost diagnostics expose all populations under `mppi/iteration_N/` (one-based display names)
and the zero-based failed index as `mppi/failed_iteration`. On failure, a warning prints the failed
population and earliest geometric event. Debug logging and offline retuning write
`<frame>_rollout_diagnostics.csv`, with one row per iteration and `failed=1` for the first failed
iteration. This sidecar does not change existing replay inputs.

### Lambda adaptation

Lambda stays fixed throughout a control step. The final eligible population determines the next
step's temperature using bounded log-ratio feedback:

```text
target_ess = target_ess_ratio * eligible_count
log_step = clamp(lambda_adaptation_gain * log(target_ess / ESS), -log(2), log(2))
lambda_next = clamp(lambda_used * exp(log_step), lambda_min, lambda_max)
```

Adaptation holds lambda unchanged for failed or degenerate populations, a zero gain, or a target at
or below the number of tied minimum-cost samples (the attainable ESS floor). `lambda_min` must be
at least `1e-6`. These guards prevent temperature windup when cooling cannot improve selection.
The factor-of-two bound permits faster recovery from concentrated weights without unbounded jumps.
The gain now acts on an ESS ratio in log space; existing gain values have a different response.

`unsafe_rollout_fraction_threshold` now controls the diagnostic `unsafe_rollout_population` flag
only. It never raises lambda or changes sampling noise. Exploration recovery is separate from
weighting; an entirely unsafe population invokes fallback rather than averaging unsafe samples.
Diagnostics also report the eligible count and tied-minimum count alongside ESS.

Raw-cost diagnostic downloads retain the actual final-iteration costs, including clipped-tail,
unsafe, and nonfinite values. They are not reconstructed from weights. This uses one persistent
rollout-sized device buffer and one device-to-device copy per control cycle, with host download
only when requested.

Multiplying all state/control cost coefficients by a common positive scalar normally leaves
weights unchanged, except at the small-range threshold; relative cost balances remain significant.

## 13. Parameter sources and shipped configuration

There are three parameter representations:

- `param/trajectory_mppi_optimizer_parameters.yaml`: generated ROS parameter schema and defaults;
- `config/mppi_optimizer.param.yaml`: shipped runtime override values;
- `FirstOrderDubinsMppiCostParams`: direct C++ API and offline-tool defaults.

They are not identical, so a value should always be interpreted with its source. With the current
shipped `config/mppi_optimizer.param.yaml`, the main cost settings are:

| Family                       | Current shipped settings                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Weighting                    | `lambda=0.1`, bounds `[0.01, 1.0]`, target ESS ratio `0.2`, robust percentile `0.95`   |
| Index tracking               | `track_coeff=0`, `heading_coeff=0`, `track_terminal_scale=1`                           |
| Independent terminal         | `terminal_error_coeff=2500`, `terminal_heading_coeff=2000`                             |
| Spatial tracking             | `lateral_distance_coeff=200`, `lateral_yaw_error_coeff=50`                             |
| Spatial progress             | `remaining_distance_coeff=0.02`, `path_overshoot_coeff=50`                             |
| Spatial velocity             | `spatial_overspeed_coeff=50`                                                           |
| Alternate footprint tracking | `track_center_coeff=0`, `corner_buffer_coeff=200`, corner margin `0.3 m`               |
| Command                      | `accel_cmd_coeff=0.5`, `steer_cmd_coeff=20`                                            |
| Comfort                      | lateral acceleration `10`, lateral jerk `1`, longitudinal jerk `2`, steering rate `20` |
| Kinematic interval           | effective `overlimit_coeff=10000`                                                      |
| Lateral barrier              | threshold `1.2 m`, soft margin `0.5 m`, target penalty `50000`                         |
| Obstacle barrier             | collision margin `0.2 m`, safe margin `0.5 m`, target penalty `50000`                  |
| Road-border barrier          | collision margin `0.2 m`, safe margin `0.5 m`, target penalty `50000`                  |
| Drivable-area barrier        | safe margin `0`, weight `0` (disabled)                                                 |

The active cost mix is therefore primarily terminal pose, spatial corridor/progress/overspeed,
command effort, comfort, kinematic limits when supplied, and obstacle/road/lateral barriers.

## 14. Review findings

### 14.1 Drivable-area cost is not an inside/outside cost

The 2D drivable texture stores unsigned point-to-segment distance. Subtracting the ego-circle
radius makes contact negative, but a vehicle far outside the boundary again has a large positive
distance and no barrier cost. `pointInPolygon()` exists as a geometry helper but is not used, and
`setDrivableAreaPolygon()`/`clearDrivableArea()` are declared without an implementation. The hard
validator also does not check drivable-area containment. If drivable containment is required, this
should become a true signed distance or an explicit polygon/occupancy check.

### 14.2 Actuator-delay comfort mismatch — resolved (L7)

The earlier command/post-step-state proxy has been replaced by physical transition outputs, as
described in section 7.2. Both host and device cost paths consume the same rates, including jerk-limit
evaluation. `test_costs.cu` covers lag, delays, saturation, and the inertial lateral-jerk convention.
The focused queued-command regression and extended GPU replay additionally check that command
changes do not trigger physical jerk-limit costs before the delay expires. These latest test changes
are pending execution.

### 14.3 `overlimit_coeff` is not connected to the generated plugin parameters

`overlimit_coeff` exists in `FirstOrderDubinsMppiCostParams`, the direct ROS helper, offline tools,
and the shipped config. It is absent from `trajectory_mppi_optimizer_parameters.yaml` and is not
copied in `TrajectoryMppiOptimizer::make_cost_params()`. The live trajectory-processor plugin thus
uses the C++ struct default (`10000`) rather than a generated parameter value. The shipped value
happens to match that default, masking the issue.

### 14.4 Several cost components are omitted from live diagnostics

`FirstOrderDubinsMppiCostBreakdown::componentTotal()` includes `lateral_boundary` and all three
kinematic overlimit components, but `publish_cost_diagnostics()` does not publish those four keys.
The Python visualizer expects `state/lateral_boundary` and `kinematic/*_overlimit`, so these terms
can be active and included in totals while appearing absent from the live stacked breakdown.

### 14.5 `crash_contact_penalty` is named and documented like a direct hard-crash cost

The parameter is a barrier calibration target and kinematic-cost cap, not an extra cost added at
contact. Exact obstacle/road-border contacts exclude sampled rollouts and are checked again in final
validation. The circle-based barrier need not equal this target at exact rectangular contact.
Renaming the parameter or clarifying its generated description would reduce tuning errors.

### 14.6 Spatial projection uses the globally closest finite segment

Host and GPU projection now examine every segment. Texture seeds and previous-query hints affect
evaluation order only; equal computed distances select the lowest segment index. The selected
segment drives lateral distance, yaw, progress, reference velocity and terminal path costs. Signed
lateral offset and endpoint-extension behavior are unchanged. This objective can switch branches
at crossings; it does not impose continuity of route progress.

This resolves the local-search discrepancy in K7 in source, with validation pending. Query work is
O(n), up to 255 corridor segments. Measure the existing performance cases and the new 256-point
hairpin case before adding acceleration; see [K7_VALIDATION.md](K7_VALIDATION.md).

### 14.7 Reference velocity is assumed finite

Corridor reference velocities are copied and interpolated without an `isfinite` check. A NaN makes
the `overspeed > 0` condition false and silently disables spatial overspeed at that projection.
Input trajectory validation should guarantee finite velocity values or sanitize this array before
upload.

### 14.8 Raw-cost variance telemetry counts non-finite rollouts inconsistently

The fused CUDA statistics kernel excludes non-finite raw costs from its moment sums, but the host
divides those sums by the total rollout count rather than the finite rollout count. This does not
change the rollout weights or any cost term, but it biases free-energy variance telemetry whenever
some rollouts are non-finite.

### 14.9 The distance-map viewer is not a direct cost visualization

The OpenGL viewer displays point-to-segment/OBB texture values. The rollout cost subsequently
accounts for the ego circle radius and, for obstacle and road-border costs, adds the collision
margin to the barrier activation distance. The viewer is passed only `obstacle_safe_margin` and
`road_border_safe_margin`. Its red/green transition is therefore useful for inspecting the raw
fields, but it does not mark the exact clearance at which the footprint-level rollout barriers
activate.

## 15. Practical tuning notes

- Tune relative families, not a common global scale, because current-rollout robust normalization
  removes most global scaling effects.
- Keep `terminal_error_coeff` separate from `track_terminal_scale`: the former targets the full
  input endpoint, while the latter scales several terminal copies of running spatial/index costs.
- `remaining_distance_coeff` is accumulated at every stage; even a small coefficient can dominate
  a long corridor because the early-horizon remaining distance is large and squared.
- `lateral_boundary_soft_margin` controls both where the barrier begins and its derived curvature.
  Increasing it starts the barrier earlier but lowers its derived weight so the cost still reaches
  `crash_contact_penalty` at the hard threshold.
- Obstacle and road safe margins similarly alter both activation range and derived weight.
- Setting `drivable_area_barrier_weight` to zero disables only the drivable boundary field. The
  lateral, obstacle, and road barriers remain calibrated from `crash_contact_penalty`.
- A post-filtered or velocity-profile-overwritten output should be assessed with `output_total_cost`;
  the sampled `baseline_cost` describes a different sequence and is not expected to match exactly.
