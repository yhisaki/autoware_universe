   * @brief Temporal consistency: weakly track the previous cycle's own plan.
   *
   * The model output is re-sampled every cycle and is not temporally coherent, so
   * consecutive plans can differ even when nothing in the scene changed. These weights add a
   * second tracking term whose reference is the previous solution of the same candidate,
   * shifted by the time elapsed since it was computed, which makes the published trajectory
   * evolve smoothly instead of jumping between equally good interpretations of the scene.
   *
   * The term is a low-pass filter on the plan and trades consistency against responsiveness
   * to new model output. Same longitudinal/lateral split as the tracking weights - a lower
   * longitudinal weight lets the timing float while the path stays put.
   *
   * The weights decay over the horizon. The near stages are what the controller actually
   * executes, so they should be held still, while the far stages are a prediction that is
   * *supposed* to move as new information arrives - pinning them down is what makes the
   * planner slow to react. The weights are therefore scaled per stage by
   *
   *   alpha(t) = far_weight_ratio + (1 - far_weight_ratio) * exp(-t / decay_time_constant_s)
   *
   * where t is the stage's time from the start of the horizon.
   *
   * The reference is the previous *solver solution*, not the previous published trajectory,
   * so postprocessing (e.g. stop point fixing) does not feed back into the optimization. It
   * is only applied while a previous solution is available and fresh, i.e. under exactly the
   * conditions that also make it usable as a warm start.
