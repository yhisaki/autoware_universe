# Traffic Light Compliance Checker

The `traffic_light_compliance_checker` package provides a deterministic validation layer that cross-references planned vehicle trajectories against real-time perceived traffic light signals and High-Definition (HD) vector maps to enforce strict traffic compliance.

## Core Features

1. **Signal State Tracking (`TrafficLightStatusTracker`)**
   - Eliminates perception jitter and signal flickering by maintaining a temporal state history for each traffic light group ID.
   - Leverages stable duration thresholds before validating a transition to `RED` or `AMBER`.
   - Utilizes a hysteresis buffer to sustain known states during transient object occlusions.

2. **Trajectory Validation (`TrafficLightComplianceChecker`)**
   - Scans forward trajectory segments sequentially to isolate intersection entry points.
   - Appends a physical front-bumper projection to ensure the vehicle footprint stays behind regulatory stop lines.
   - Implements a kinematic pass/stop feasibility matrix for `AMBER` signals based on comfortable braking and intersection clearance times.
   - Returns prioritized, chronological arrays of `Violation` metadata if an unvalidated stop line overshoot is detected.

## Inner Workings

### Main Processing Pipeline

The execution flow follows a sequential logical from signal processing & filtering down to stop line interaction evaluations:

1. **Filter signals and update status tracker:** Feeds raw perception data into the status tracker to clean up transient noise and tracking dropouts.
2. **Generate Geometric Trajectory Linestring:** Removes path points situated behind the ego vehicle, clamps the forward path length at the maximum required stop distance, and extends trajectory end to account for ego front offset.
3. **Extract and group map stop lines:** Sorts overlapping intersection lines into separate evaluation queues for red and amber constraints.
4. **Evaluate Stop Line Violations:** Checks the trajectory linesting against active stop lines, records detected violations and generate compliance result.

### Signal Status Tracker Filtering

To prevent sudden, harsh emergency braking maneuvers caused by raw perception noise, the status tracker filters raw signals through three deterministic mechanisms before passing them to the validation layer:

- **State Persistence Buffering:** Incoming state transitions (e.g., green to amber/red/unknown) must continuously persist for a minimum time window (`stable_duration_threshold_red`, `stable_duration_threshold_amber`, or `stable_duration_threshold_unknown`) before the new state is considered valid. If a signal flips color or alters elements before this duration threshold is reached, its active elements array is cleared to suppress transient sensor noise.
- **History Eviction Buffer:** If a traffic light group drops out of the incoming message matrix completely, the tracker retains its record for a brief clearing window. The duration an un-updated signal persists in memory is dynamically determined by its last recorded color state: `stable_duration_threshold_red` for red signals, `stable_duration_threshold_amber` for amber signals, and `stable_duration_threshold_unknown` for other non-red, non-amber conditions. If the signal remains un-detected beyond this frame timeout, its stale context is permanently erased from the tracking ledger.
- **Ego-Stopped Pass-Through Gate:** The tracker continuously evaluates the current motion of the ego vehicle via `is_ego_stopped`. When the vehicle has brought itself to a halt beneath the configured `ego_stopped_velocity_threshold`, the entire stability duration filtering logic is completely bypassed. This pass-through guarantees that the vehicle maintains maximum responsiveness to incoming state changes while stationary, eliminating filtering-induced latency during intersection departures.

### Safety & Compliance Logic

- **Segment-by-Segment Geometric Scan:** The checker evaluates trajectory segments sequentially against mapped stop lines using a localized `boost::geometry::intersection` check. The loop breaks immediately upon finding the first chronological intersection point, calculating the dynamic distance-to-stop-line and interpolating the exact crossing timestamp (for amber light) using `autoware::interpolation::lerp`.
- **Red Light Evaluation:** Generates a violation if an intersection occurs, unless the trajectory makes the ego come to a complete stop within the specified `stop_overshoot_margin`.
- **Amber Light Evaluation:** Computes the dynamic stopping distance based on current velocity, acceleration, applied deceleration, and system response latency. If the vehicle can stop safely before the line, or if it cannot clear the intersection within the `crossing_time_limit`, an amber violation is recorded to enforce a stop.
