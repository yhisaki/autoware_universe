0.53.0 (2026-09-29)
-------------------
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into prepare-0.53.0-changelog
* feat(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): apply agnocast_wrapper::Node to crop_box_filter (`#13384 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13384>`_)
  * feat(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): apply agnocast_wrapper::Node to crop_box_filter
  Derive CropBoxFilterComponent from AgnocastFilter, the
  FilterBase<autoware::agnocast_wrapper::Node> instantiation, and register it
  through autoware_agnocast_wrapper_register_node on an agnocast-only
  callback-isolated executor. crop_box_filter_node.launch.xml resolves
  LD_PRELOAD through agnocast_env.launch.xml.
  DiagnosticsBase::add_to_interface() takes an autoware_utils::DiagnosticsInterface,
  an rclcpp-only type, and a virtual method cannot be a template. The diagnostic
  classes are therefore templatized on the node type, with
  `using X = BasicX<rclcpp::Node>` leaving every filter still on rclcpp unchanged.
  * refactor(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): rename the Basic diagnostics templates to Generic
  ---------
* feat(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): apply agnocast_wrapper::Node to polar_voxel_outlier_filter (`#13383 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13383>`_)
  * feat(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): templatize Filter into FilterBase<NodeT>
  Turn `Filter` into `FilterBase<NodeT>` so filter nodes can be moved onto
  `autoware::agnocast_wrapper::Node` one at a time. `Filter` stays as a class
  deriving from `FilterBase<rclcpp::Node>`, so every node that has not been
  migrated keeps compiling unchanged.
  * feat(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): let FilterBase run on an agnocast-only executor
  * feat(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): apply agnocast_wrapper::Node to polar_voxel_outlier_filter
  * fix(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): use the buffer-only TransformListener in FilterBase
  * refactor(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): keep ManagedTransformBuffer in FilterBase
  ---------
* feat(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): apply agnocast_wrapper::Node to voxel_grid_downsample_filter (`#13072 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13072>`_)
  * refactor(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): templatize Filter into FilterBase<NodeT>
  * feat(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): apply agnocast_wrapper::Node to voxel_grid_downsample_filter
  * style(pre-commit): autofix
  * feat(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): register voxel_grid_downsample_filter through the agnocast wrapper
  The node now derives from agnocast_wrapper::Node, so under ENABLE_AGNOCAST=1 it needs the
  generated main that calls agnocast::init(). Loaded into a component container instead, the
  AgnocastOnly executor aborts the whole container because the agnocast signal handler is not
  installed in that process. The macro falls back to rclcpp_components_register_node at
  ENABLE_AGNOCAST=0, so the non-agnocast build is unchanged.

* test(cuda_pointcloud_preprocessor): cover capacity bounds behavior (`#13137 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13137>`_)
  * perf(cuda_pointcloud_preprocessor): avoid runtime thrust allocations
  Thrust's algorithm calls allocate temporary device memory on every frame.
  Replace them with explicit kernels and CUB calls running on storage that is
  allocated once at startup:
  - thrust_stream::fill / fill_n become a fill kernel launched on the stream
  - thrust::inclusive_scan becomes cub::DeviceScan::InclusiveSum
  - thrust_stream::count becomes cub::DeviceReduce::Sum over a transform
  iterator, accumulating the three diagnostic counters into one device
  buffer that is copied back in a single transfer
  The CUB calls share a single scratch workspace, sized at startup to the
  largest requirement among the sort, the scan and the reductions. The twist
  struct counts become locals, since they are only used within process().
  The counting iterator is thrust::transform_iterator rather than
  cub::TransformInputIterator, since CCCL 3.0 (CUDA 13, used on jazzy) removed
  the latter along with its header.
  * refactor(cuda_pointcloud_preprocessor): name the processing stat indices
  Hoist the device_processing_stats\_ layout into class-scope constants so that
  the buffer sizing in initializeBuffers() and the readback in process() share
  one definition instead of repeating a bare 3.

  * refactor(cuda_pointcloud_preprocessor): clarify queue update flow
  The twist and IMU queue bookkeeping was spread over the insertion callbacks
  and a pair of bounding helpers, so capacity was enforced after insertion and
  the pruning rules were duplicated per queue. Move the bookkeeping into
  detail:: helpers in a new queue_bounds.hpp and give each queue one update
  path:
  - prepare_queue_update() prunes queue entries older than the current
  pointcloud, drops and counts incoming messages beyond the free capacity,
  and sorts the remainder, so capacity is enforced before insertion
  - twistCallback()/imuCallback() become insertTwistMessage()/
  insertImuMessage(), which now only insert in stamp order
  - boundTwistQueue()/boundImuQueue() are gone, since nothing is inserted
  beyond capacity any more
  Backward time jump handling moves to detail::is_backward_time_jump() and now
  tolerates jumps of up to one second: the queue is cleared only when its
  oldest entry is more than one second ahead of the incoming stamp, rather than
  on any backward step. The old per-entry pop for queues spanning more than a
  second is dropped, since prepare_queue_update() already prunes everything
  older than the current pointcloud.
  * refactor(cuda_pointcloud_preprocessor): address queue_bounds review comments
  - Convert builtin_interfaces/Time to nanoseconds from its own fields, which
  drops the rclcpp dependency from queue_bounds.hpp entirely. A negative
  `sec` throws rather than wrapping, which is what rclcpp::Time did too
  - Document and assert that prune_old_queue_entries() takes a stamp-sorted
  queue and leaves it sorted
  - Document what prepare_queue_update() does and the state it leaves its two
  containers in
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * test(cuda_pointcloud_preprocessor): cover capacity bounds behavior
  Add a gtest suite for the behavior introduced by the preceding commits in
  this stack:
  - CudaPointcloudPreprocessor accepts positive capacities and rejects
  non-positive ones
  - points exactly at the ring and points-per-ring capacities are processed
  without reporting an overflow, and exceeding either reports one
  - input clouds longer than max_input_point_count are truncated
  - detail::prepare_queue_update() prunes, sorts, bounds and counts drops for
  both the twist and IMU queues, and rejects an already over-capacity queue
  - detail::is_backward_time_jump() honors the one second threshold
  The cases that construct a CudaPointcloudPreprocessor allocate device memory,
  so they use autoware::cuda_utils::CudaTest and self-skip where no CUDA device
  is present; CI containers run without one. The capacity validation and queue
  bound cases are pure host code and always run.
  * fix(cuda_pointcloud_preprocessor): link the test dependencies properly
  `LINKER:--no-as-needed` on the gtest target was papering over two libraries
  that never declared the dependencies they use:
  - `cuda_pointcloud_preprocessor_lib` calls into cuda_blackboard but did not
  link it
  - `concatenate_data` calls the memory utilities that live in
  `pointcloud_preprocessor_filter_base` but did not link it
  Both now link what they use, so `libconcatenate_data.so` and
  `libcuda_pointcloud_preprocessor_lib.so` carry the DT_NEEDED entries they were
  missing. The test target only has to name `cuda_pointcloud_preprocessor_lib`,
  and the linker resolves the rest on its own with `--as-needed` left at its
  default.
  Also split the ring capacity boundary case into one case per capacity that
  `ring_overflow` reports, and pass the ring of every test point explicitly, so
  which of the two limits each case exercises is visible at the call site.

  * chore: empty commit to nudge the pull request diff
  * refactor(cuda_pointcloud_preprocessor): report ring organization overflow as flags
  `organizeKernel` recorded the maximum *offending* ring index and ring offset
  via `atomicMax`, but the magnitudes never left `process()`: the only sink is
  the `bool ProcessingStats::ring_overflow`, so both were effectively flags
  whose names promised observed maxima. That mismatch made the `>=` comparisons
  against the capacities read like off-by-one errors.
  Raise the two outputs as flags and name them accordingly. The reported
  `ring_overflow` is unchanged for every input.

* fix(design): align the sensing node designs with the packages they describe (`#13337 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13337>`_)
  CalibrationStatusClassifier declares a preview_image publisher on a hardcoded
  per-camera topic that the node no longer creates, and names it as the outcome
  of the classify process.
  The point cloud concatenation component is built as concatenate_pointclouds_node.
* feat(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): apply agnocast_wrapper::Node to random_downsample_filter (`#13386 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13386>`_)
  Add AgnocastFilter, the FilterBase<autoware::agnocast_wrapper::Node>
  instantiation, and derive RandomDownsampleFilterComponent from it. Register it
  through autoware_agnocast_wrapper_register_node and resolve LD_PRELOAD in its
  launch file through agnocast_env.launch.xml.
  FilterBase keeps ManagedTransformBuffer for tf in both instantiations, which
  managed_transform_buffer`#29 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/29>`_ makes usable without an rclcpp context.
* feat(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): templatize Filter into FilterBase<NodeT> (`#13331 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13331>`_)
  Turn `Filter` into `FilterBase<NodeT>` so filter nodes can be moved onto
  `autoware::agnocast_wrapper::Node` one at a time. `Filter` stays as a class
  deriving from `FilterBase<rclcpp::Node>`, so every node that has not been
  migrated keeps compiling unchanged.
* fix: disable test when agnocast in `blockage_diag` and `polar_voxel_outlier_filter` (`#12484 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12484>`_)
  * disable test when agnocast in blockage_diag and polar_voxel_outlier_filter
  * fix(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): keep polar_voxel_noise_filter_node test enabled with agnocast
  * refactor(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): minimize the diff of the agnocast test guard
  ---------
* refactor(sensing): move node design files into each package (`#13105 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13105>`_)
* fix(autoware_pointcloud_preprocessor): fix azimuth_diff 1deg threshold math (`#13147 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13147>`_)
  Fixes `#13146 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13146>`_.
  `azimuth_diff` is in radians, and a `1deg` threshold was being converted incorrectly, leading to a `3283deg` threshold instead.
* chore(pre-commit): update clang-format to v22.1.5 (`#13126 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13126>`_)
  * chore(pre-commit): update clang-format to v22.1.5
  * style(pre-commit): autofix
  ---------
* fix(pre-commit): update pre-commit-hooks-ros to v0.10.3 and adapt include guards (`#13083 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13083>`_)
  * chore: sync files
  * fix(pre-commit): adapt include guards to pre-commit-hooks-ros v0.10.3
  ros-include-guard v0.10.3 only recognises an include guard when #endif is the
  last non-empty line of the file, so that feature test macros are no longer
  mistaken for guards. 29 headers failed that check.
  25 headers wrap the guard in "// clang-format off" / "// clang-format on"
  because the #endif comment plus its // NOLINT exceeds the 100 column limit.
  Drop only the trailing "on" marker; the "off" marker then runs to end of file
  and still protects the line from being wrapped.
  3 CUDA headers ended with "/* *INDENT-ON* */". Move it above the #endif so it
  stays paired with the "/* *INDENT-OFF* */" near the top of the file.
  autoware_behavior_path_planner/test/input.hpp closed its guard immediately after
  opening it, leaving the entire body unguarded. Move the #endif to the end.
  Also hold clang-format at v21.1.8. clang-format 22 migrates
  "AlignAfterOpenBracket: AlwaysBreak" to "BreakAfterOpenBracketIf: true", which
  forces a break after every "if (" whose condition does not fit on one line and
  reformats 88 files.

  * refactor(pointcloud_preprocessor): extract matching policy and rename collector matcher
  Extract the pure cloud-to-collector matching logic (naive / advanced) into
  a ROS-runtime-free MatchingPolicy operating on plain structs
  (IncomingCloudInfo, CandidateCollectorState, CollectorReference).
  Rename CollectorMatchingStrategy -> CollectorMatcher; the matcher classes
  become thin wrappers that adapt the ROS-side collectors to the policy and
  hold the node/logging dependency. Rename MatchingParams -> IncomingCloudInfo
  at the node call sites. The CUDA package's matcher is renamed in lockstep
  (it shares the same header).
  No behavioral change.

* fix: prevent possible dangling pointer from .str().c_str() pattern (`#11609 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/11609>`_)
  * Fix dangling pointer caused by the .str().c_str() pattern.
  std::stringstream::str() returns a temporary std::string,
  and taking its c_str() leads to a dangling pointer when the temporary is destroyed.
  This patch replaces such usage with a const reference of std::string variable to ensure pointer validity.
  * Revert the changes made to the functions. They should only be applied to the macros.
