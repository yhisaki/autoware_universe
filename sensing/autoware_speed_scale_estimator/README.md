# autoware_speed_scale_estimator

## Overview

This package estimates the vehicle speed scale factor by comparing pose-derived velocity from consecutive localization poses with wheel velocity reported by the vehicle. The reference velocity is computed from pose position differences (e.g. NDT scan matcher output), so the estimate reflects consistency between localization motion and wheel speed.

The estimated scale factor can be used to monitor and tune the speed scale in `autoware_vehicle_velocity_converter`. The node runs periodically at `update_interval` and updates the estimate only when all operational constraints are satisfied.

## Package Architecture

The package is split into a core library and a ROS adapter layer. The core implements estimation without ROS topic subscription or publication; it uses `rclcpp::Time` only for timestamp handling. Core logic can be unit-tested without spinning up a ROS graph.

## Algorithm

The speed scale estimation follows these steps:

### 1. Data Collection

- Collects pose (`PoseStamped`), IMU, and vehicle velocity reports (`VelocityReport`) received since the previous timer callback
- Keeps IMU and velocity report messages in rolling buffers of length `sensor_buffer_duration` for timestamp synchronization
- Keeps the previous pose internally to compute pose velocity between consecutive updates

### 2. Pose Velocity Calculation

Computes pose velocity from the previous and current poses:

$$
v_{pose} = \frac{\| \Delta \mathbf{p} \|}{\Delta t}
$$

If the time difference between the two poses exceeds `max_pose_lag`, the previous pose is reset and estimation is skipped.

### 3. Timestamp Synchronization

For the current pose timestamp, the estimator selects from the rolling buffers:

- the nearest IMU sample for angular velocity constraint checking
- the nearest velocity report for Kalman filter observation

Estimation is skipped when either timestamp difference exceeds `max_stamp_lag`.

### 4. Constraint Validation

Estimation is performed only when all of the following constraints are satisfied:

- **Angular velocity constraint (IMU)** — $|\omega_{imu}| \leq \omega_{max}$

  Default $\omega_{max} \approx 0.6\ \mathrm{deg/s}$ ($0.0105\ \mathrm{rad/s}$) rejects obvious curves and turns. This threshold is set near the practical IMU bias/noise floor rather than fine straight-line discrimination.

- **Speed constraints (pose velocity)** — $v_{min} \leq v_{pose} \leq v_{max}$

  Default $v_{min} = 6.0\ \mathrm{m/s}$ rejects low-speed samples where pose-differentiation SNR is poor: at short $\Delta t$, displacement $\|\Delta \mathbf{p}\|$ becomes comparable to localization pose noise (e.g. NDT jitter), so relative error in $v_{pose} = \|\Delta \mathbf{p}\| / \Delta t$ grows and corrupts the scale-factor observation $z = v_{pose}$. Wheel speed reports also tend to have larger relative uncertainty near standstill or creep. In practice, sub-6 m/s segments are often urban and involve frequent acceleration/deceleration, which further degrades consistency between pose-derived and wheel-reported velocity. Default $v_{max} = 17.0\ \mathrm{m/s}$ filters out extreme speeds. Together with $\omega_{max}$, estimation runs mainly on moderate-speed, near-straight segments (~22 km/h and above).

  Estimation is intentionally skipped in urban/low-speed segments. Lower `min_speed` if broader coverage is needed, accepting higher estimate variance.

- **Wheel velocity validity** — $|v_{wheel}| > 10^{-6}$

### 5. Scale Factor Estimation (Kalman Filter)

The scale factor is modeled as a scalar state $x$ with the observation:

$$
z = v_{pose} = x \cdot v_{wheel}
$$

Kalman filter update:

**Prediction:**

$$
x_{pred} = x,\quad P_{pred} = P + Q
$$

**Update:**

$$
H = v_{wheel},\quad y = z - H x_{pred}
$$

$$
S = H^2 P_{pred} + R,\quad K = \frac{P_{pred} H}{S}
$$

$$
x = x_{pred} + K y,\quad P = (1 - K H) P_{pred}
$$

### Tuning

Default constraint values are a practical starting point, not vehicle-specific optima. If estimation accuracy is insufficient, tune `max_pose_lag`, `max_stamp_lag`, `sensor_buffer_duration`, `max_angular_velocity`, `min_speed`, `max_speed`, and Kalman noise parameters per vehicle and operation. For urban or general-road monitoring, consider lowering `min_speed` and increasing `measurement_noise_covariance` to tolerate noisier pose-differentiation observations. IMU bias cancellation or other preprocessing may allow a stricter angular velocity threshold; without it, thresholds near the IMU noise floor are expected.
