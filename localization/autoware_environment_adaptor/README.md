# Autoware Environment Adaptor Node

## Purpose

This package adapts localization inputs based on the driving environment.
It classifies the current position using Lanelet2 map polygons and applies environment-specific adjustments to:

- **Pose covariance** — replaces the NDT pose covariance with values tuned for the current environment before feeding the EKF localizer.
- **Twist longitudinal velocity** — scales the vehicle-reported longitudinal speed before it enters the gyro odometer.

This is useful in environments where localization accuracy or wheel-speed reliability changes predictably by location, such as tunnels (uniform road) or feature-poor road sections.

## Function

The node performs two independent adaptations on each callback:

| Input                        | Adaptation                                              | Output                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `PoseWithCovarianceStamped`  | Replace covariance based on classified `environment_id` | `PoseWithCovarianceStamped`  |
| `TwistWithCovarianceStamped` | Multiply `linear.x` by `longitudinal_scale_factor`      | `TwistWithCovarianceStamped` |

> - This package does **not** modify pose position or orientation.
> - This package does **not** modify twist covariance or angular velocity.
> - Pose covariance values are defined in the **body frame** and rotated into the map frame using the current pose orientation.

## Assumptions

- The Lanelet2 vector map contains `degenerate_area` polygons that mark degenerate localization areas.
- NDT scan matcher is used as the pose estimator (`pose_source` includes `ndt`).
- Gyro odometer is used as the twist estimator (`twist_source` is `gyro_odom`).
- The NDT matcher outputs a pose with a fixed covariance that does not reflect the actual localization uncertainty in every environment.

## Requirements

- A geo-referenced Lanelet2 map with environment polygons (see [Degenerate area setup guide](doc/degenerate_area_setup.md)).
- Parameter files that define environment IDs, pose covariances, and longitudinal scale factors for each environment.

## Description

Accurate covariance values are important for the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in `autoware_ekf_localizer`.
NDT scan matcher typically publishes poses with preset covariance that does not change with the driving environment.

Similarly, wheel-speed-based twist can be biased in certain road conditions (e.g., uniform tunnel sections).
This node allows per-environment tuning of both pose covariance and longitudinal velocity scale using map-based classification.

### Environment classification

`EnvironmentClassifier` loads Lanelet2 polygons whose `type` attribute is `degenerate_area`.
These areas are where geometric features are insufficient to constrain at least one translational or rotational degree of freedom in scan matching or lane line matching.
For each incoming pose, the node checks whether the vehicle position is inside any such polygon.

Classification priority for `longitudinal_scale_factor` (only inside a `degenerate_area` polygon):

1. Polygon attribute specified by `map_longitudinal_scale_factor_attribute` (default: `longitudinal_scale_factor`)
2. `default_longitudinal_scale_factor` (when the polygon has no such attribute)

Outside all `degenerate_area` polygons (or before the map is ready), **no scaling is applied** (the twist passes through unchanged). `default_longitudinal_scale_factor` is **not** applied globally.

The polygon `subtype` attribute is mapped to an `environment_id` via `area_subtype_<subtype>.environment_id` parameters.

### Pose covariance adaptation

Configured covariance matrices are 6×6 row-major arrays (36 elements) for `(x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw)`.
They are stored in the body frame and rotated to the map frame before publishing.

If no `environment_<id>_output_pose_covariance` is configured for the classified environment ID, the input pose covariance is passed through unchanged.

### Standalone launch

```bash
ros2 launch autoware_environment_adaptor environment_adaptor.launch.xml

## Environment ID reference

The default parameter file defines the following environment IDs:

| ID  | Name               | Typical use case                                   |
| --- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | Normal environment | Default when outside any `degenerate_area` polygon |
| 1   | Uniform road       | Straight tunnel sections, uniform road surface     |
| 2   | Feature-poor road  | Areas with few LiDAR features for NDT matching     |

Add new environments by:

1. Defining a new `area_subtype_<name>.environment_id` mapping.
2. Adding `environment_<id>_output_pose_covariance`.
3. Annotating map polygons with the corresponding `subtype` (and `longitudinal_scale_factor` attribute if velocity scaling is needed).

## FAQ

### How is pose covariance applied when the map is not ready?

If the Lanelet2 map has not been received yet, classification falls back to `default_environment_id` for pose covariance, and **no longitudinal velocity scaling is applied** (the twist passes through unchanged).

### When is `default_longitudinal_scale_factor` applied?

Only when the vehicle is inside a `degenerate_area` polygon that has no per-polygon `longitudinal_scale_factor` map attribute. Outside all polygons (or before the map is ready), the twist is passed through unchanged regardless of this value. This keeps the scaling effect scoped to annotated areas rather than the entire map.

### What happens if covariance parameters are missing?

If no `environment_<id>_output_pose_covariance` is configured for the classified environment ID, the node passes through the input pose covariance unchanged.

### Can this package be used with `autoware_pose_covariance_modifier`?

Both packages redirect the NDT output topic when enabled.
They serve different purposes (GNSS-based covariance switching vs. map-based environment adaptation) and are typically not used together.
Review your launch configuration carefully if you need to combine them.

### How are overlapping polygons handled?

Polygons are evaluated in map load order.
The first polygon that contains the vehicle position is used.

### Does twist scaling affect gyro odometer covariance?

No. Only `twist.twist.linear.x` is scaled. Covariance and other twist components are unchanged.

### Which position is used to classify the environment for twist scaling?

Twist scaling is classified using the **most recently received pose position**, not the position at the twist message timestamp. Pose messages are used to update the classification, and each twist message reuses the latest classified position.

Because of this, when the pose rate is lower than the twist rate (typical for NDT vs. wheel-speed inputs) or near a `degenerate_area` polygon boundary, the applied scale factor can lag by up to one pose cycle. For example, just after entering or exiting a tunnel, the scaling may briefly reflect the previous side of the boundary until the next pose arrives.

This is acceptable for the intended tunnel use cases, where the vehicle stays inside the polygon for long stretches and only the short boundary transitions are affected. If boundary flicker becomes an issue in testing, consider one of the following:

- Offset the polygon boundaries a few meters inward from the physical entrance/exit in the Lanelet2 map.
- Classify at the twist stamp using pose interpolation (requires keeping a short pose history).
- Add a throttled debug log when `|t_twist - t_pose|` exceeds a threshold to quantify the lag.
