0.53.0 (2026-09-29)
-------------------
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into prepare-0.53.0-changelog
* feat(multi_object_tracker): tracker batch trigger on stale target stream (`#13181 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13181>`_)
  * Fix tracker batch trigger on stale target stream
  * style(pre-commit): autofix
  * Fix channel optimizer timer behavior
  * Restore input manager optimizer order
  * Address review: freshness cap, target hysteresis, gradual latency shift
  - cap the freshness timeout so a rate-dropped channel is not relaxed into
  the 'fresh' condition by its own grown interval statistics
  - call optimizeChannelTimings() only from the optimizer timer, not from
  InputManager::getObjects()
  - keep the current target stream unless another fresh stream exceeds its
  latency by the hysteresis, while a stale target still fails over at once
  - rate-limit the increase of target_stream_latency\_ so the batch window
  does not jump backward and export objects older than the tracker time
  - add deterministic regression tests for the three behaviors above

  * fix(multi_object_tracker): keep batch window open to the target stream during latency convergence (`#13259 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13259>`_)
  * fix(multi_object_tracker): keep batch window open to the target stream during latency convergence
  The gradual target latency shift moves the batch window end while the
  window start stays at the export watermark; measurements below the
  window start are dropped by getObjectsOlderThan(). After a target
  dropout and recovery, the recovered stream's measurements fall into
  that gap for the whole convergence period. The window start now stays
  at or below the target stream's newest measurement, bounded by the
  1-second interval.
  Also:
  - push objects with the node's current_time so association processing
  time is not folded into the stream latency statistics
  - de-vacuize SelectsLargestLatencyStreamAfterTimingOptimization by
  placing the high-latency channel off the default target index
  - add a dropout-failover-recovery regression test
  * refactor(multi_object_tracker): flatten getObjectTimeInterval bound selection
  The target stream's newest measurement is fetched once, and the window
  bounds are clamped with min/max: the window end stays at or above it,
  the window start at or below it, within the 1-second interval.

* fix(autoware_multi_object_tracker): prefer fresh bbox tracker over long partially-updated tracker in overlap pruning (`#12996 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12996>`_)
  * refactor(multi_object_tracker): restructure overlap merge into a staged pipeline
  Extract the tracker overlap merge into a merger/ module: shared snapshot and
  decision-context types (detail/overlap_types), the spatial gate (detail/
  overlap_gate, per-label pruning distances), and the survival ranking
  (detail/survival_ranking). tracker_overlap_manager drives a four-stage
  pipeline — snapshot, decide directed merge edges, group one best winner per
  loser, apply the star-forest merges. Move redundancy_check under merger/detail
  and update includes.

  * feat(multi_object_tracker): rank a loser's competing winners by substance
  Group merge edges with compareWinnerSubstance — priority, confidence, known
  probability, position covariance, measurement count — so the intrinsically
  stronger winner claims a contested loser; distance and UUID only break ties.
  Apply merges strongest-winner-first so star-forest conflicts resolve toward
  the stronger edge.

  * feat(multi_object_tracker): add tolerance deadband to overlap ranking comparisons
  Introduce withinDeadband, a relative-or-absolute tolerance band, and apply it to
  the continuous-quantity comparisons in overlap ranking: the position-covariance
  survival tier and the distance tie-break between equally-strong winners. Values
  that differ only within the band compare equal and defer to the next tie-break.

  * feat(multi_object_tracker): rank overlap survival by full-measurement freshness
  Track the time of each vehicle tracker's last full (trust_extension)
  measurement in tracker_base and expose getElapsedTimeFromFullMeasurement:
  the stabilized extension update also refreshes it, and non-vehicle trackers
  always count as fully measured. The overlap merge snapshots a
  fully_measured_stale flag (elapsed > 0.35 s) and adds a survival tier that
  prefers the fresh, fully-measured tracker, so a tracker coasting on partial
  updates yields to a fresh bbox-spawned tracker.

  * feat(multi_object_tracker): gate overlap pairs by size-aware multi-circle cover
  Replace the per-label distance-threshold gate with a size-aware spatial gate:
  cover each tracker's extents with a chain of equal circles along its longer
  axis and admit a pair only when their circles fall within
  (radius_a + radius_b + margin), via a bulk-loaded R-tree. Parametric shapes
  take their extents from dimensions; polygon shapes from their footprint's
  bounds in the object frame. Remove the now-unused pruning_distance_thresholds
  parameter from configuration, schema, node, and tests.

* feat(autoware_multi_object_tracker): new function to add odometry uncertainty (`#9139 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/9139>`_)
  * feat: add Odometry uncertainty to object tracking
  * feat: Add odometry heading uncertainty to object pose covariance
  feat: Rotate object pose covariance matrix to account for yaw uncertainty
  Rotate the object pose covariance matrix in the uncertainty_processor.cpp file to account for the yaw uncertainty. This ensures that the covariance matrix accurately represents the position uncertainty of the object.
  Refactor the code to rotate the covariance matrix using Eigen's Rotation2D class. The yaw uncertainty is added to the y-y element of the rotated covariance matrix. Finally, update the object_pose_cov array with the updated covariance values.
  Closes `#123 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/123>`_

The function normalizes the position and twist covariance matrices of detected objects to ensure minimum values for distance, radius, and velocity. This helps improve the accuracy and reliability of object tracking.
