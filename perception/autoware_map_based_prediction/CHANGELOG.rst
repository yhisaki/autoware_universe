0.53.0 (2026-09-29)
-------------------
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into prepare-0.53.0-changelog
* perf(map_based_prediction): vru path-cut follow-up optimizations (`#13238 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13238>`_)
  * fix(map_based_prediction): cut at the earliest fence crossing
  The candidate loop stopped at the first crossed fence in R-tree order, so
  a different fence crossing earlier along the path was never examined and
  the cut landed too late. Collect every crossed fence; the segment loop
  already returns the earliest crossing.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * perf(map_based_prediction): convert path-cut map geometry once at load
  Vegetation polygons are converted to boost polygons and validated when
  the map arrives; the per-cycle loops look the conversions up by id. A
  vegetation-free map leaves the layer null so queries short-circuit.
  Road boundaries are converted to 2D once per crossed boundary and
  crosswalk rings are cached at load. Bounds shared by two road-subtype
  lanelets are interior lane dividers and are dropped from the boundary
  layer: a path from outside the road always reaches an outer edge first.

  * perf(map_based_prediction): cheapen vegetation crossing tests
  Cylinder footprints sweep the centerline buffered by their radius, so
  segment-vs-polygon distance tests replace the per-segment convex hulls
  and are exact; box and polygon shapes keep the hulls but reuse each
  segment's end footprint as the next start. Candidates are gated by one
  centerline-to-polygon distance test in place of the N-footprint
  bounding box, and the R-tree query box is grown by the footprint radius
  so polygons reachable by the swept footprint are not missed.
  The road-boundary segment test resolves intersection points in a single
  sweep, keeping intersects() only as the collinear-overlap fallback.

  * perf(map_based_prediction): build each predicted-path linestring once
  The caller converts a path to a 2D linestring once and hands it to the
  fence and vegetation modules; the fence-cut prefix is reused for the
  vegetation cut. Fences crossed by a path are converted to 2D once
  instead of per segment, and the road-boundary module shares the utils
  conversion helper.

  * test(map_based_prediction): add VRU path-cut module tests
  Synthetic in-memory lanelet maps pin the behavior the modules must
  preserve: earliest-crossing cut index, the initial-overlap exemption,
  detection of polygons reachable only by the swept footprint, invalid
  map polygons skipped at load, interior lane dividers excluded from the
  boundary layer, the crosswalk signal exemption, and the can-stop gate.

* feat(map_based_prediction): add vegetation path cutting (`#13190 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13190>`_)
  * feat(map_based_predictor): add vegitation path cut , (`#3113 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/3113>`_)
  add path cut function by vegetation
  (cherry picked from commit 7be16b3d11cf67fd67fff0fecb482ed8157f3cd2)
  * chore(map_based_prediction): remove path cut debug
  * feat(map_based_prediction): judge vegetation path cut on path segments (`#3221 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/3221>`_)
  Cherry-picked vegetation.cpp changes from `tier4/autoware_universe#3221 <https://github.com/tier4/autoware_universe/issues/3221>`_, excluding test_vegetation.cpp.
  (cherry picked from commit 2e365e13641e084f5d0f55194deb0a2577c751fe)
  * refactor(map_based_prediction): remove vegetation info precheck
  * perf(map_based_prediction): skip precise path cut checks by bbox
  * perf(map_based_prediction): skip vegetation cross checks by bbox
  * style(map_based_prediction): use at for indexed path access
  * fix(map_based_prediction): hold the vegetation layer as a const map
  vegetation_layer\_ was a non-const LaneletMapUPtr, so polygonLayer.search()
  selected the non-const overload and returned std::vector<lanelet::Polygon3d>,
  which does not bind to the const lanelet::ConstPolygons3d & the crossing
  helpers take. The layer is only ever searched after being built, so hold it
  as a LaneletMapConstUPtr; search() then returns ConstPolygons3d directly and
  the call sites need no conversion.

  * fix(map_based_prediction): keep the path footprint polygon alive while iterating
  buildPathFootprintBBox() iterated over to_polygon2d(...).outer() directly.
  to_polygon2d() returns by value and outer() returns a reference into it, but
  in a range-for only the result of the range expression is lifetime-extended,
  so the Polygon2d temporary was destroyed before the loop body ran. GCC 13
  reports the dangling access as -Werror=maybe-uninitialized, which broke the
  Jazzy CI build.
  Bind the footprint to a named local so it outlives the loop.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * fix(map_based_prediction): report the vegetation crossing closest to the object
  findVegetationCrossingIndex() looped over the candidate polygons outside the
  segment loop, so the index it returned belonged to whichever polygon the
  R-tree yielded first rather than to the first crossing along the path: with
  two polygons over the path, a crossing on segment 5 could be returned while
  the polygon crossed on segment 1 was never examined.
  Segment 0's swept polygon also covers the object's current footprint, so an
  object standing under a mapped tree reported a crossing at index 0, dropping
  every crosswalk path and truncating the straight path to a single pose. A
  path leaving a vegetation area is not a path entering one, so return no
  crossing when the initial footprint already overlaps the vegetation.
  Collect the polygons that pass the bbox check first, then walk the segments
  outermost. This also stops the swept hulls being rebuilt per candidate
  polygon, and the empty-candidate early return keeps the bbox rejection as
  cheap as it was.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * refactor(map_based_prediction): make doesPathCrossVegetation a thin wrapper
  doesPathCrossVegetation() was findVegetationCrossingIndex() with last_idx
  clamped to arrival_index, so it carried its own copy of the polygon/segment
  loop and would need the same two fixes applied twice.
  Take last_idx as a parameter instead and let the boolean form delegate.
  PredictedPathWithArrivalIndex derives from PredictedPath, so it passes
  straight through; cutPathsCrossingVegetation() supplies path.size() - 1.

* feat(map_based_prediction): cut VRU paths jumping onto the road at road boundaries (`#13203 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13203>`_)
  * feat(map_based_prediction): add per-class object deceleration parameters
  Introduce behavior_model.object_deceleration, the deceleration [m/ss] each
  object class is assumed to be able to apply. It is used to judge whether an
  object can come to a stop before a line its predicted path crosses.
  A class that has an entry of its own uses that value; every other class falls
  back to behavior_model.object_deceleration.base, so only the classes that
  deviate need to be listed in the parameter file. Every class defined in
  autoware_perception_msgs::msg::ObjectClassification can be configured.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * feat(map_based_prediction): cut VRU paths jumping onto the road at road boundaries (`#3213 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/3213>`_)
  Add a RoadBoundaryModule that trims VRU predicted paths which jump out onto
  the road at the right/left bound of road / road_shoulder lanelets. Following
  the fence module pattern, the logic lives in a dedicated road_boundary.cpp
  and is invoked from predictor_vru.cpp so it applies only to VRUs.
  - Collect road / road_shoulder lanelet bounds into a searchable layer
  - Cut at the crossing closest to the object among multiple crossed boundaries
  - Skip cutting when the crossing point lies inside a crosswalk / walkway
  (treated as a legitimate crossing), unless the crosswalk's traffic signal
  is red (gated by use_crosswalk_signal)
  - Skip cutting for objects already inside a road lanelet
  - Cut only when the object can decelerate to a stop before the boundary
  - Add TrafficSignalModule::isRedSignal() reusing getSignalId/getSignalElement
  Cherry-picked from `tier4/autoware_universe#3213 <https://github.com/tier4/autoware_universe/issues/3213>`_. The path_cut_debug marker
  publishing is omitted since that module does not exist here.

  * fix(map_based_prediction): take agnocast_wrapper::Node in the deceleration param helpers
  MapBasedPredictionNode derives from autoware::agnocast_wrapper::Node since
  `#12879 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12879>`_, and that class does not derive from rclcpp::Node, so the helpers
  introduced for behavior_model.object_deceleration could not be called with
  *this. Take the wrapper node instead, as the other agnocast-migrated
  parameter helpers do.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * style(pre-commit): autofix
  * fix(map_based_prediction): hold the road boundary layer as a const map
  The layer is only searched after being built, and crosswalk_layer\_ next to it
  is already a LaneletMapConstUPtr. Holding it as a non-const map made
  lineStringLayer.search() resolve to the non-const overload wherever the map is
  reached without a const qualifier.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * fix(map_based_prediction): constrain the base deceleration to non-positive
  The parameter is a deceleration expressed as a negative acceleration, so a
  positive value is always a misconfiguration. Reject it in the schema.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * fix(map_based_prediction): declare every object deceleration with base as its default
  The try/catch fallback absorbed real misconfiguration: an integer literal such
  as 'pedestrian: -1' makes declare_parameter<double> throw, and the class then
  quietly took the base value with no log line. It also left the classes missing
  from the parameter file undeclared, so they never showed up in ros2 param list.
  Declaring each class with base as its default covers both, and a type mismatch
  now fails loudly at start-up.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * fix(map_based_prediction): drop the unused lanelet2_extension include
  road_boundary.cpp only uses lanelet::utils::to2D, createMap and createConstMap,
  all of which come from lanelet2_core/LaneletMap.h that road_boundary.hpp
  already includes. The autoware_lanelet2_extension header was never needed, and
  the package does not declare that dependency.
