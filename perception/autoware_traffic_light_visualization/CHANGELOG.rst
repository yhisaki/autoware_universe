Changelog for package autoware_traffic_light_visualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.53.0 (2026-09-29)
-------------------
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into prepare-0.53.0-changelog
* test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): add characterization test for TrafficLightRoiVisualizerNode (`#13392 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/13392>`_)
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): add characterization test for TrafficLightRoiVisualizerNode
  Pin the observable behavior of TrafficLightRoiVisualizerNode before its
  logic is separated from rclcpp::Node. The node is driven through its real
  topics and the drawing is checked by reading pixels out of the published
  image, so a regression that stops the drawing from running is caught.
  No production code is touched: the change adds a test file and its own
  test target next to the existing ones.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): cover the remaining branches of the visualizer
  Two paths were left untested by the characterization suite:
  - the image_transport publish inside imageRoughRoiCallback, because the
  image transport case ran the other callback
  - strToColor()'s red and yellow, because only green and the fallback were
  pinned, although the README documents all three
  Line coverage of node.cpp goes 93.7% -> 94.4% and of node.hpp 92.6% ->
  100%. What is left in node.cpp is the two cv_bridge catch blocks, which
  cannot be tested without taking the test binary down.

  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): make the pixel checks say what they check
  Review feedback: the assertions did not make it clear what each test was
  looking for.
  Every pixel read now goes through a named variable, and the read sits
  next to the assertion it belongs to, under a line saying what the two of
  them establish. Where a test makes several claims, each claim is its own
  group. The coordinates behind the label box are explained once, on the
  two helpers that return them, instead of in each test.
  The tests for a ROI with and without a signal now read the same two
  points, so the label box is the only difference between them.
  The three known signal colors get a case each instead of a loop, which
  also drops the SCOPED_TRACE and the output\_ reset the loop needed.

0.52.0 (2026-06-30)
-------------------
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into tmp/bot/bump_version_base
* test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): retire characterization test and rename core unit test (`#12612 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12612>`_)
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): retire characterization test for TrafficLightMapVisualizerNode
  The characterization test introduced in `#12487 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12487>`_ has served its purpose
  as the safety net during the refactor series (`#12511 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12511>`_ / `#12553 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12553>`_ / `#12591 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12591>`_
  / `#12596 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12596>`_). Its scope is now fully covered by the finer-grained layers:
  - extract_bulbs unit tests: lanelet -> Bulb conversion
  - TrafficLightVisualizer core unit tests: bulb -> marker generation
  - Node smoke tests: pub/sub plumbing and map-not-received guard
  Remove the characterization test and its CMakeLists.txt entry. The
  remaining test executables run an order of magnitude faster, with no
  loss of behavioural coverage.
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): rename TrafficLightVisualizer unit test to take the package's main test slot
  With the characterization test retired, the unit test file for
  TrafficLightVisualizer is the most natural fit for the package's main
  test name. Rename it from test_traffic_light_map_visualizer_core.cpp
  to test_traffic_light_map_visualizer.cpp and update the matching
  ament_add_gtest target name in CMakeLists.txt accordingly.
  No content changes; this is a pure rename + CMake target rename.
* test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): add extract_bulbs unit tests and node smoke test (`#12596 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12596>`_)
  test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): add extract_bulbs unit tests and node smoke test
  - 9 unit tests for extract_bulbs (attribute filters, color resolution, multi-bulb / multi-traffic-light cases).
  - 2 Node smoke tests (happy path + detection-before-map guard).
  - Move test files into test/traffic_light_map_visualizer/ to mirror src/.
  No production code change.

* test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): add unit tests for TrafficLightVisualizer (`#12591 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12591>`_)
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): add unit tests for TrafficLightVisualizer
  After Option B refactor, TrafficLightVisualizer is independent of
  lanelet primitives, so its marker generation logic can be exercised
  directly with synthetic Bulb structures. The new test file covers
  8 cases (color mapping, silent skip, partial matches, multi-group
  aggregation, and the empty-input boundaries) without ROS spin-up.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): inline single-use test helpers
  make_point and make_element each had only one caller (make_bulb and
  make_group respectively). Folding them into their callers keeps the
  test helpers complete in one place and removes a layer of indirection.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): replace magic group ids with named constants
  Promotes 100, 200, 999 to test_group_id, another_test_group_id, and
  non_existent_group_id, matching the existing arbitrary_id /
  non_existent_id convention used in the characterization tests.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): align EmptyDetection test with AAA pattern
  Extract make_detection({}) into the Arrange section so the test follows
  the same structure as the other seven cases.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): use non_existent_group_id constant in Test 5
  The constant was already defined but unused; the test referenced the
  literal 999 directly. Switch to the named constant for consistency
  with test_group_id and another_test_group_id.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): zero out unused bulb positions
  The position values 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 in single-bulb tests and the
  positions 1.0/2.0/3.0 keyed to the bulb id in OnlyDetectedColorsAreShown
  were never asserted. Use 0, 0, 0 uniformly to remove setup noise.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): promote arbitrary bulb id 42 to named constant
  Match the existing arbitrary_id / non_existent_id naming convention.
  Bulb ids 1-4 in OnlyDetectedColorsAreShown and TwoGroupsBothMatched
  remain numeric since those values are intentionally distinct.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): assert marker inherits bulb id and position
  Position drives where rviz draws the marker, so it is part of the
  observable output contract. Add a focused test that verifies both the
  id and the x/y/z coordinates flow from Bulb to Marker.
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): strengthen multi-group attribution checks
  # Conflicts:
  #	perception/autoware_traffic_light_visualization/test/test_extract_bulbs.cpp
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): silence position noise via make_bulb overload
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): cover marker header, group mix, and per-bulb position
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): drop trivial MarkerHeaderCarriesStampAndMapFrame test
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): reorder test_traffic_light_map_visualizer_core by scenario
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): drop trivial id/position assignment test
  MarkerInheritsBulbIdAndPosition only verifies that bulb.id and
  bulb.position propagate through create_bulb_marker as direct
  assignments, which is low value to test in isolation. The
  TwoGroupsBothMatchedProduceFourMarkers test already covers per-bulb id
  and position propagation, and the characterization test exercises the
  end-to-end path. Remove the redundant trivial test.
  * test(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): inline single-use helpers and document id-to-x setup in TwoGroupsBothMatchedProduceFourMarkers
  - Inline collect_marker_ids and index_markers_by_id into the only test
  that uses them. The two map/set lookups are now built in a single pass
  over the markers, matching the pattern from b631187c0 of inlining
  single-use test helpers.
  - Add a setup comment explaining the bulb id N -> x = N.0 convention so
  the position assertions are self-explanatory and the aliasing-guard
  intent is visible.

* refactor(autoware_traffic_light_visualization): introduce Bulb struct and tidy internal naming (`#12553 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12553>`_)
  Second of a planned series of incremental refactors for
  traffic_light_map_visualizer (follow-up to `#12511 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12511>`_).
  - Introduce Bulb { id, position, color } and BulbsByGroupId, and
  extract `extract_bulbs(map_traffic_lights) -> BulbsByGroupId` as a
  free function. TrafficLightVisualizer no longer holds
  lanelet::ConstPoint3d; lanelet API knowledge is confined to the
  conversion seam.
  - Extract `parse_bulb_color` helper.
  - Tidy helper signatures (pass Time by value, hoist `using` to
  namespace scope) and scope TrafficLightGroupArray / LaneletMapBin
  aliases to the node class private section.
  - Internal renames for clarity: viz_lanelet_map -> lanelet_map,
  regulatory_element -> traffic_light, traffic_lights ->
  map_traffic_lights, current_time -> stamp, plus subscription /
  publisher / callback member updates.
  - Drop noisy "Map is loaded" debug log.
  - Update copyright year to 2020-2026.
  Behavior is preserved end-to-end; the characterization test from
  `#12487 <https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_universe/issues/12487>`_ acts as the safety net.

  a safety net to ensure behavior is preserved during upcoming logic
  separation and code cleanup.
